Hello all!

I'm embarking on one of the most exciting and life changing events to date - learning to code!
I love learning and believe coding will help me through the next chapter of my life as I discover what it means to balance life and work into the one sphere but also how I can contribute to society.
I will definitely make mistakes (and may possibly fail) at my many attempts at being an awesome coder but hey, any experience is better than no experience and as much as it sounds cliche, it's about the journey and not the outcome.
I hope anyone that is remotely interested in my coding journey to help provide any comments, feedback, constructive criticism, or anything down to "your code is shit" to help a noob coder out.
